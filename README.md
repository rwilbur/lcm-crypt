# lcm-crypt
## About
The most recent project I have been experimenting with is LCM (Lightweight Communications Marshalling). It is a lightweight framework to send multicast messages over a network and makes it easy to handle receiving messages on different channels. This application will have symmetric encryption so that all traffic between the server and client(s) will be encrypted. 

Note that this is still very much a work in progress and I am only working on it in my free time which can be hard to find.
